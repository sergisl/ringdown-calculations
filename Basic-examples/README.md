Here you can find two basic examples for the application of black hole perturbation theory in GR and Horndeski gravity.

- [Schwarzschild-GR](https://github.com/sergisl/ringdown-calculations/blob/main/Schwarzschild-GR.nb): derivation of Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations for a Schwarzschild black hole in GR by applying the perturbations at the level of the action.

- [Schwarzschild-Horndeski](https://github.com/sergisl/ringdown-calculations/blob/main/Schwarzschild-Horndeski.nb): derivation of 3 master equations (gravitational odd, gravitational even, scalar even) for a Schwarzschild black hole in Horndeski gravity.
