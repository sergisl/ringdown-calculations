Here you can find the companion notebooks to the paper [[2503.XXXX]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.XXXX), where we explore black hole solutions in cubic/quadratic higher-order scalar-tensor (HOST) theories. These notebooks construct an adaptable general formalism for the study of cubic HOST theories at
the background and perturbative levels, which can be tuned to specific models.

- [Inverting-no-hair-theorems-I](https://github.com/sergisl/ringdown-calculations/blob/main/Inverting-no-hair-theorems/Inverting-no-hair-theorems-I.nb): In this notebook we define cubic HOST theories, derive the covariant equations of motion and obtain the conditions for the existence of stealth GR solutions. This corresponds to the calculations in Section 2 of [[2503.XXXX]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.XXXX).

- [Inverting-no-hair-theorems-II](https://github.com/sergisl/ringdown-calculations/blob/main/Inverting-no-hair-theorems/Inverting-no-hair-theorems-II.nb): In this notebook we derive the quadratic Lagrangian for odd black hole perturbations in cubic HOST theories. This corresponds to the calculations in Sections 3 and 4 of [[2503.XXXX]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.XXXX).

- [precomputed-expressions](https://github.com/sergisl/ringdown-calculations/tree/main/Inverting-no-hair-theorems/precomputed-expressions): The notebooks above contain calculations that can take several minutes to complete. This can be avoided by loading the precomputed expressions contained in this folder. To do so, one needs to place these files in a path accessible by Mathematica. You can check the list of accessible paths by Mathematica by typing $Path in Mathematica. You can append a new path with AppendTo[$Path, "your_path"].
