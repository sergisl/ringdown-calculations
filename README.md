A collection of notebooks for black hole perturbation theory calculations in GR and modified gravity.

- [Schwarzschild-GR](https://github.com/sergisl/ringdown-calculations/blob/main/Schwarzschild-GR.nb): derivation of Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations for a Schwarzschild black hole in GR by applying the perturbations at the level of the action.

- [Schwarzschild-Horndeski](https://github.com/sergisl/ringdown-calculations/blob/main/Schwarzschild-Horndeski.nb): derivation of 3 master equations (gravitational odd, gravitational even, scalar even) for a Schwarzschild black hole in Horndeski gravity.

- [Testing-speed-gravity](https://github.com/sergisl/ringdown-calculations/blob/main/Testing-speed-gravity.nb): companion notebook to the paper [[2301.10272]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10272), where we investigate how the speed of gravitational waves can be tested with ringdown observations. We focus on odd parity quasinormal modes of hairy black holes in Horndeski theories.

  **Summary of contents**: This notebook contains all calculations starting from the covariant action to the final Fisher parameter estimation and all details in between (quadratic action, modified Regge-Wheeler equation, scalar hair and other parametrizations, quasinormal mode calculation, construction of waveform with relevant parameters, calculation of SNR and errors, plots).

- [Stability-QNMs-SdS-t-dep](https://github.com/sergisl/ringdown-calculations/blob/main/Stability-QNMs-SdS-t-depl.nb): companion notebook to the paper [[2408.01720]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01720), where we investigate the stability and quasinormal modes of black holes with time-dependent scalar hair.

  **Summary of contents**: This notebook contains all calculations starting from the covariant action to the final Fisher parameter estimation and all details in between (background equations of motion, quadratic action, stability conditions, modified Regge-Wheeler equation, WKB quasinormal mode calculation, construction of waveform with relevant parameters, calculation of SNR and errors).
  > *This notebooks make use of the free WKB package in [[1904.1033]](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.10333.pdf)*.

  - [plots-Stability-QNMs-SdS-t-dep](https://github.com/sergisl/ringdown-calculations/blob/main/plots-Stability-QNMs-SdS-t-dep.ipynb): python code for all plots in [[2408.01720]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01720).


> *These notebooks make use of the computer algebra package [xAct](http://www.xact.es/index.html), so their correct evaluation requires the prior installation of xAct. [Installation files](http://www.xact.es/download.html) are freely available together with [extensive documentation](http://www.xact.es/documentation.html).*
