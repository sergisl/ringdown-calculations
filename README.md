# ringdown-calculations
A collection of notebooks for black hole perturbation theory calculations in GR and modified gravity.

- [Schwarzschild-GR](https://github.com/sergisl/ringdown-calculations/blob/main/Schwarzschild-GR.nb): derivation of Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations for a Schwarzschild black hole in GR by applying the perturbations at the level of the action.

- [Schwarzschild-Horndeski](https://github.com/sergisl/ringdown-calculations/blob/main/Schwarzschild-Horndeski.nb): derivation of 3 master equations (gravitational odd, gravitational even, scalar even) for a Schwarzschild black hole in Horndeski gravity.

- [Testing-speed-gravity](https://github.com/sergisl/ringdown-calculations/blob/main/Testing-speed-gravity.nb): companion notebook to the paper [[2301.10272]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10272), where we investigate how the speed of gravitational waves can be tested with ringdown observations. We focus on odd parity quasinormal modes of hairy black holes in Horndeski theories.

  **Summary of contents**: This notebook contains all calculations starting from the covariant action to the final Fisher parameter estimation and all details in between (quadratic action, modified Regge-Wheeler equation, scalar hair and other parametrizations, quasinormal mode calculation, construction of waveform with relevant parameters, calculation of SNR and errors, plots).


> *These notebooks make use of the computer algebra package [xAct](http://www.xact.es/index.html), so their correct evaluation requires the prior installation of xAct. [Installation files](http://www.xact.es/download.html) are freely available together with [extensive documentation](http://www.xact.es/documentation.html).*
